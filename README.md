# pandas-challenge - Analysis

This dataframe provides information on several schools within a school district in relation to test scores for students in math and reading. The information can be used to deduce whether adequate funding is being provided to help students achieve academic success and it looks at the different school types (Charter versus District) to see if one is more successful than the other.

From this information we can see that if a school is small or medium (2000 or less), they tend to have better performing students in both math and reading. When schools start to have 2000 or more, the grades drop for both reading and math leading to a depreciation in students that are passing.

Though overall budgets vary wildly based on school size, the overall spending per student is roughly the same. 

This data could benefit from additional information in terms of class size and the student to teacher ratio. This way we could see if student success is more based on class size rather than budgeting and school type.
